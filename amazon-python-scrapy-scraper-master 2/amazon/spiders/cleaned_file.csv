0,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2023-10-15,"Who would have thought.... I'm a hard core fan of Logitech mice. My primary mouse is an MX Master 3 and I love it. On my gaming laptop I was using a Targus bluetooth 'travel' mouse, I've had it for many years and its worked well but the clip on back top of the mouse slides back for the batteries access, broke. So I needed a new mouse.Since I wanted an inexpensive mouse that I could use on any of the devices I have that use bluetooth and I wanted it battery powered. How many of you have had a rechargeable device fail when you needed it and then had to wait, sometimes hours, for whatever to recharge when it would have taken seconds to replace the batteries. So I saw this mouse, it was very inexpensive (compared to Logitech or other name brands) and it had a LOT of reviews and had all the things I wanted, so I bought it.So here's the good:- I have large hands and while a little smaller than a full size mouse it's a nice size in my opinion. Not as small as the Targus but not as big as the MX Master 3.- it was very easy to pair with Windows 11 (games only) and my MacBook Pro (mostly work)- the dpi is very easy to adjust and easy to see the effect.- the scroll button work well and is quiet but there is tactile feed back.- the mouse buttons are easy to press and quiet.- the sleep mode works well and I don't know if I'll get 24 months.- 36 month warranty on a $14 mouse. impressive.The maybe not so good:- There is no mouse software for the device. This is good and maybe not so good. I haven't really decided but to be honest I usually don't use it much when it is provided.- The top shell is all one piece and there is a slit cut for the right and left buttons and space for the scroll wheel. I'm not sure if this is good or bad but it is different from every other mouse I have. I guess time will tell.The Bad & the Ugly:- I have not experienced anything that I would label as such.Other observations:- The battery compartment is on the bottom of the mouse.- it had a nice weight. there are no weight adjustments like I've seen on gaming mice but I've never owned a mouse that like that so....- Its worked well for the Steam games that I've played.- The purple is a nice shade and beats the heck out of yet another dark gray/gray/silver mouse.This is a far far better mouse than I ever expected. I would recommend this to anyone with the caveat that these are initial impressions after only a few hours of use and my opinions, over time, may vary."
1,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2015-03-05,"Review of TeckNet BM306 Bluetooth Wireless Mouse (Replaced by: New Model BT5.0 Mouse) For some reason, Technet is still using this same listing on Amazon that used to be for their discontinued BM306 mouse for this fairly new model, the EWM01308 (it will be identified by your computers Bluetooth module as BT5.0 Mouse). The old BM306 was a good value, this mouse is about the same price but even better. It is a little larger, has better heft because it uses two AA batteries instead of just one, there are six DPI settings instead of three, and the color of the side buttons is an undistracting black instead of red. It tracks smoothly, the buttons are slightly noisy but all work well (fully compatible with my Mac and the BetterTouchTool driver software I use), the scroll wheel is smooth and fairly quiet but has nice tactile stops. I cant comment on the battery life yet. I especially like that the mouse generates basic Button 3, Button 4 etc. values instead of the buttons being hard-coded for Page Up, Page Down, etc. as are Logitech and many other mice because the basic Button X values make using third-party mouse drivers much easier. This mouse is a great upgrade relative to the old BM306 and at the current price of between $11 and $16 depending on what color you choose and what discounts are currently being offered, it is a fantastic value. If Technet revised this mouse again I hope they add a third thumb button and a tilting scroll wheel but its quite nice as it is.Below is my old review of the BM306 from about 6 years ago: Over the last 25 years I've owned a bunch of mice and and similar input devices ranging in quality from the crappy hockey puck that shipped with the first iMacs to some really nice Logitech units. I currently spend most of my time using an Apple Magic Mouse supplemented by an Apple Magic Trackpad and sometimes an Apple Bluetooth Mighty Mouse.Recently I've been playing some games and while the input devices I have were working OK I really wanted a few more buttons and physical buttons rather than just a touch surface over one big button. I gave some thought to pulling out one of my old Logitech MX1000 mice, which are really great, but while wireless they rely on a base station that has to be plugged into AC and a USB port, neither of which I wanted to bother with. I looked at Logitech's current offerings and all the mice I like use a unifying receiver which fits into a USB port and I didn't want to dedicate a USB port for this purpose.Just browsing mice on Amazon I saw this one, the TeckNet BM306. Bluetooth, 5 buttons (left click, right click, scroll wheel/middle click, and a pair of thumb buttons), a scroll wheel, and it seemed to be normal size, i.e. not huge but not made to be especially portable/tiny, either. The price caught my eye, too: Under thirteen bucks. The reviews were mixed but I decided to give it a try.The tracking is smooth and it works on my bare desk, my mouse pad, my thigh, and the arm of my leather lounge chair. I didn't spend time testing it on other surfaces such as mirrors; why would I ever want to use it on a mirror? All the buttons click and register with a good feel but a bit more volume than you might desire if using it in a shared space.The tracking speed, even at the lowest resolution, is faster than my Magic Mouse but tolerable so I don't have to adjust system settings every time I pick up the TeckNet mouse or resort to third-party drivers which allow tracking speed to be set on a device-by-device basis. I'll never use the button on the mouse to change the resolution but for those who find that useful you press that button once and the resolution changes and then the button flashes between one and three times to tell you which resolution setting you just changed to. If this were a function I was going to use I would prefer a slide selector on the bottom of the mouse rather than a button on the top with a flashing light indicator whose meaning has to be memorized.The scroll wheel works very nicely with a perceptible but smooth click as it rotates. Nothing's as good as scrolling with a touch surface but as physical scroll wheels go the one on this mouse is fine. I liked the scroll wheel tilt/left-right scroll/left-right buttons on my Logitech MX1000 mice but if I wanted more buttons I guess I would have looked at some other mouse instead of the BM306.I have a bit of third-party software on my Mac called BetterTouchTool which allows me to assign pretty much whatever functions I like to my mouse buttons. By default, the thumb buttons are back and forward which, in a web browser, will take you to your previous page or the reverse. I prefer to have them work as page down and page up in most applications (although it barely matters since I'm only using this mouse for a few games). Something like USB Overdrive would allow even more customization but BetterTouchTool is good enough for my current purposes and I have it running all the time for other functions, anyway.I wish the thumb buttons were a muted silver or black because the mouse is very professional-looking except for those red buttons on the side. A very minor quibble to be sure but the mouse would look less cheap with a different color choice on these parts.I haven't owned this mouse long enough to verify the claimed battery life but the mouse has three progressive, automatic, and very aggressive sleep modes so I wouldn't be surprised if a single AA battery were to last 15 months. I use rechargeable batteries so it will be a bit shorter for me but as long as it lasts a few weeks I'll be satisfied. In fact, I wish I could disable or at least adjust the mouse's power-saving behavior because while it wakes up with a click and reconnects to my Mac in just a second or three I'd rather that it not go into sleep mode in the time it takes me to walk to the bathroom, do number one, and walk back to my office. This is the only real complaint I have with the mouse and it's a very minor issue. I imagine that it might be more of an issue for users of non-Mac computers which tend to have less reliable communication with Bluetooth devices and I think that's likely the cause of the connection issues reported in most of the low-scoring reviews here. Less aggressive activation of power-saving sleep modes would probably eliminate most of these complaints.At this price I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. The mouse is a great value and if you can live with the infrared rather than a laser, it has enough buttons for your needs, you're right-handed, and you don't have baby or gargantua hands; it's well worth a try especially with Amazon's guarantee backing up your purchase."
2,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2023-12-05,"Bigger than expected, typically excellent Technet quality Ive got 3 or 4 Technet mice, some have the rounded nose and some the slant one, this has the slant one but this one is bigger and heavier than the other slant nose I have. The difference is the old one uses two AAA batteries and this one uses 2 AA batteries.I use all of these on iPhones, iPads and Amazon Fire tablets. All work perfectly. I have hdhomerun tuners and dvr on my lan and use them with their AppStore app. In the iPhones and iPad I have mapped the side buttons to control volume +/- and the wheel button to open the task switcher.The one downside is Apples fault in the stupid way they manage mice, as of iOS 17 mice can only be used when assistive touch is enabled - when the mouse goes to sleep the OS plants a bit dot on the screen to take over assistive touch from the mouse. Its ugly, it gets in the way and its hard not to see it as punishment for not using a genuine Apple mouse (which doesnt provide even 1980s mouse functionality).Anyway these mice are my go to."
3,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2023-11-09,"Fantastic for the price! I needed a mouse for my new work laptop and prefer bluetooth as I don't like dealing with an RF receiver, which blocks a possibly needed USB port. Found this one on a lightning deal, read the reviews, and felt it worth a try for less than $10, which is quite a bit less than some brand names out there. It arrived promptly and Win 11 recognized it almost immediately after I pushed the 'pair' button on the bottom of the mouse. It has good size and weight and, so far, has been working perfectly: scroll wheel works well and right and left clicking are easy and response is immediate. There was no special software for the mouse to be downloaded; however, I rarely have even bothered to look when there is, generally sticking to the 'generic' settings, where you can make most basic changes within the OS software (both Windows and MacOS) for general operation. I like replaceable batteries since you don't have to worry about the mouse quitting on you in the middle of a project and having to track down a charger cord and a place to plug it in. They say the batteries will last for up to 36 months.....I'll be happy if they go half that long. Remember to register with the seller to get a 3 year warranty, too! Recommended."
4,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2023-11-28,"For the Price, I'm impressed. This is my first Bluetooth wireless mouse purchase. I must say that I'm reasonably impressed with its performance thus far. I can't really attest to it's performance as far as gaming, but it is pretty responsive on the Bluetooth 5.0 protocol. It paired up with my Linux Mint OS on my Asus Tuf Gaming A17 without any problem. Same with tested ABS Gladiator Gaming setup running 23H2 Windows 11. I would definitely recommend this mouse to those on a budget and needing something easily transportable. Ideal size for someone carrying a Laptop Backpack with additional storage compartments. And Yes, I'm using it as I type this review. All of the keys work well, fwd/back buttons, Change cursor dpi on the fly, scrolling, tracking, etc... For just around $12.00 when purchased, it's turning out to be quite the bargain."
5,B07C2NL5HK,True,4.0,United States,2023-11-06,"A good mouse, but bt pairing is a bit tricky I ordered this bt mouse because the wireless version from Logitech (my brand for many years) was maddeningly intermittent in my context -- some form of interference or PC radio malfunction. This unit performed well out of the box. Paired automatically. Completely smooth and reliable. Somewhat big for my hand (male, 165 lb), and certainly so compared to my Logitech version, but still OK. The tricky part came when I turned off the PC bt radio to solve a problem with my desk-top bt speakers. When I switched bt back on (with my recently-unemployed Logitech unit!) bt mouse appeared not to pair. There is a pairing button on the bottom which I dutifully pressed (many times), and a flashing blue light on top seemed to tell me it was in pairing mode, but no success. Finally in cruising the web I found some fine print: ""press and HOLD the button."" When I did that the blue light flashed more rapidly and the unit was recognized by the PC. The slower blue light seemed to have no other function than to fool me for forty five minutes. Bad Tecknet -- docked one star."
6,B07C2NL5HK,True,4.0,United States,2023-10-26,"Bluetooth connection I've had this mouse for 3 years already and I have used a lot, I love it , what I like the most is the ergonomics and the clicking. I had a problem with the connection to the laptop, that I've just solved, most of the time it worked perfectly but sometimes it struggled to connect or sometimes it connected but pointer started lagging, I just realized that the stuttering started when I connected to my Wi-Fi which was in 2.4ghz, then I connected to the 5Ghz and the mouse started working perfectly. Another thing I wanted to say is that I had to open it to clean the wheel sensor with alcohol, but that's after a few years of use. For the price is the best mouse I've used."
7,B07C2NL5HK,True,4.0,United States,2023-12-04,"Pretty good mouse Overall a good mouse for the price. Im not sure why the right side button is longer. I wish the left button is longer. I often pressed both buttons if I dont stretch my thumb further. If I have to that, then it is not very ergonomic."
8,B07C2NL5HK,True,5.0,United States,2023-11-21,"Works great, no problems at all. Just wish for a few features It works great, and I have no complaints except the side buttons are really easy to click accidentally. I have to be mindful to avoid clicking them. The one thing I do wish this had is a program to edit the buttons. Windows doesn't have a native mouse option for something like this, except for the one that switches your buttons around. I'd like a program that I can disable buttons, change the sleep settings, etc. just more control of the mouse is all."
9,B07C2NL5HK,True,4.0,United States,2023-11-27,"Feels great but what do you have to do to keep this mouse connected Like the headline says, I love the feel and ergonomics of the mouse. My hands are on the larger side and even though it's small, it just fits.My only complaint is if left untouched for any length of time, it loses its connection and you have to play with it, move it back and forth, to reconnect."
