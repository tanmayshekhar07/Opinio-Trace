0,B001RVFDOO,5,yummy,"These chips are wonderful.  My kids and I all loved the salt and pepper.<br />Each .8 oz bag was 100 calories, lots of chips for the calorie count.",2012-02-12
1,B001RVFDOO,5,Great Item,"Great packaging, and item is just as described. Will purchase this item again. They were shipped very fast, and efficient.",2012-02-12
2,B001RVFDOO,5,Excellent chips,"Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, I would highly recommend trying these out.",2012-02-11
3,B001RVFDOO,5,Perfect for WW followers,Got this item on a one-day-only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single-serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...,2012-02-10
4,B001RVFDOO,5,"Variety pack, packed lunches","I discovered Pop Chips awhile back and fell in love with the BBQ flavor- whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative. Hubby is a teacher, so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school.<br /><br />Since I mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week, I thought the variety pack would be different for him. He gets his crunchy fun and doesn't realize the Pop Chips aren't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting. Score! Plain are fine, vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor. Single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo, but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich.",2012-02-06
5,B001RVFDOO,4,Loved all the flavor except salt and pepper!,I really liked these chips as did my entire family. I wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. I would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.,2012-02-06
6,B001RVFDOO,3,chips,These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.,2012-02-06
7,B001RVFDOO,4,Good as a sampler pack of the various flavors,"I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  They're pretty noisy (like most chips) so don't take 'em to the local theater!<br /><br />These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)<br /><br />These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness.",2012-02-03
8,B001RVFDOO,5,These tastes pretty good,"These tastes good. If it's not fried, not bad for you, and tastes good, then why not eat them? Of course, not a lot at once, but these are great healthier snacks.",2012-01-31
9,B001RVFDOO,2,Didn't care for the variety selections,"I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.",2012-01-26
10,B001RVFDOO,5,BEWARE! THESE ARE ADDICTING!,"I had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local Target in 3oz. bags.  I am so glad that I bought this variety pack! Not only did I discover other flavors that I enjoy, but it's single serving size so it's better for portion control.  I love popchips, and I find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips!",2012-01-18
11,B001RVFDOO,5,Yum yum love me POP Chips,I like these chips a lot! Now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i Fish!,2012-01-17
12,B001RVFDOO,5,Can't beat the taste.,A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.,2011-12-17
13,B001RVFDOO,4,Great chips - and tasty too,"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh.",2011-12-07
14,B001RVFDOO,5,Delicious alternative to greasy traditional chips!,"These are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips.  Great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty, crunchy snack.  They are light and crunchy and they taste really good. I was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good.  The original flavor reminds me a lot of the Munchos chips.  The original flavor and salt/vinegar are my favorite but they are all good.  My least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor (I don't like cheddar) but most people really like it. I have purchased these several times now and I will continue to do so.  I  highly recommend this product for anyone!",2011-12-07
15,B001RVFDOO,4,Great snacking alternative!,"For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!",2011-11-27
16,B001RVFDOO,5,Great Gluten-free snack and healthy,"I got these for my gf as she isn't supposed to eat any gluten.  All of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips.  If you are looking for a gluten-free snack, I highly recommend Popchips!",2011-11-22
17,B001RVFDOO,4,I like all but one,"I like all the varieties except the salt and pepper.  They taste too much like black pepper and nothing else.  The others are very goodl<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO"">Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>",2011-11-22

19,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummy Yummies,I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.,2011-10-24
20,B001RVFDOO,5,Great tasting chips alternative,"These are really good tasting chips, they aren't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. Love the flavoring.",2011-10-22
21,B001RVFDOO,5,Mmm-Mmm-Mmm!!!,"I have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have I found a great choice in PopChips!  These are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips.  I love Special K cracker chips, but they only come in big bags.  I saw these and they are packaged the way I like (individual serving bags), so I gave them a try.  Now, I will never be without them!  They are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag.  Finally a good-tasting, healthier potato chip that I can enjoy!",2011-10-19
22,B001RVFDOO,5,Better than expected,"I wasn't sure about these chips, but thought I would give them a try. These are tasty, crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag! I like all the flavors included in the variety pack. I definitely will buy again.",2011-10-19
23,B001RVFDOO,5,Great Snack!,"These chips are very tasty,  Its a nice size serving and only 100 calories.  Good grab and go snack for busy Moms",2011-10-17
24,B001RVFDOO,3,pretty good. not healthy like an apple but...,"I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good - not fantastic but good.  I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.<br />Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat-filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips - eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).<br />If you do get the big box - just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them - and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two.",2011-10-13
25,B001RVFDOO,4,Pop0chips,"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks.",2011-10-08
26,B001RVFDOO,5,Love them!,Aboulutely love Popchips!I first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in California. I like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.,2011-09-28
27,B001RVFDOO,5,Great product and at a great price,This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.,2011-09-26
28,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips Review,Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!,2011-09-15
29,B001RVFDOO,5,Don't Defeat the Purpose by Eating Two Bags at Once!,"I have to watch my calories, but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact, they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag, because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value.",2011-09-11
30,B001RVFDOO,4,Great for diet,The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.,2011-09-05
31,B001RVFDOO,5,Best Chips Ever,"I love these chips, they taste so good I am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. The individual bags keep you honest. Thank you PopChips",2011-08-27
32,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop Chips,These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!,2011-08-18
33,B001RVFDOO,4,A yummy alternative to high-fat chips!,"I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!",2011-08-18
34,B001RVFDOO,5,yummy popchips,These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size,2011-08-11
35,B001RVFDOO,3,Taste yummy but watch out for yeast extract intolerance!,"Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.",2011-07-26
36,B001RVFDOO,5,Love Pop Chips!,A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.,2011-07-25
37,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop Crisps,These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.,2011-07-21
38,B001RVFDOO,5,GREAT PRODUCT!,These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.,2011-07-21
39,B001RVFDOO,2,Did not care for these. Only liked bbq. Wondering why these are best-sellers,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!,2011-07-16
40,B001RVFDOO,5,OMG!  So delicious,"I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips, they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor.  I am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend (who hates anything that's healthy).  I recommend these to all my friends.  I'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all.",2011-07-09
41,B001RVFDOO,5,great chips,"I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind,  I use the plain chips to dip with my salsa.  I would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not.",2011-07-09
42,B001RVFDOO,5,Great product,This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.,2011-05-02
43,B001RVFDOO,5,they grow on you!,"Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly, but by the time the first bag as gone (I have a husband and kids), I was hooked. Wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it. Personally, I like the plain and also the salt/pepper. My kids love all of them though and, while these aren't fruit/veggies, I feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips.",2011-05-01
44,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummy:),"We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with ""regular"" fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.",2011-05-01
45,B001RVFDOO,5,Best chips!,"I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet,  so after finally decided to order it. It arrived within 3 days! the flavor is awesome! just like what I hoped for! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesn't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are! those chips have so much flavor! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor! I have lived in the U.K. for a while and one thing I have always missed is the crisps that I used to eat in U.K. those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps! I will be order those again!",2011-04-26
46,B001RVFDOO,5,Perfect Pop Chips,"I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.",2011-04-18
47,B001RVFDOO,5,Just my 2 cents...,"I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said, Pop Chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Salt & Vinegar by far.<br /><br />The calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair!",2011-04-17
48,B001RVFDOO,3,Quite delicious but not as good as real chips,Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!,2011-04-12
49,B001RVFDOO,4,Interesting... however I've found something else...,"I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the ""Food Should Taste Good"" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.",2011-04-01
50,B001RVFDOO,5,Love These Chips,The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.,2011-03-11
51,B001RVFDOO,5,tast great less lard.,These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.,2011-03-10
52,B001RVFDOO,5,OMG!!!! The Best Snack Ever!!!,"To those of you, and there's a lot of us, who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake,these chips are A-1 in my book.<br /><br />First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.<br /><br />I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.<br /><br />They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.<br /><br />So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!<br /><br />They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.<br /><br />So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.<br /><br />Hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers!!!!!<br /><br />Keep on Munching, the Healthy way with ""POPCHIPS"" snacks.",2011-03-02
53,B001RVFDOO,5,Great price; Great taste;,"Found these while looking for good, cheap, low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office.  After my first shipment, I decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe & save.  My next shipment arrives in two days. I'm so excited!<br /><br />Gotta have my pop chips...",2011-02-28
54,B001RVFDOO,5,yum,My husband and I both really like the popchips.  They are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.,2011-02-24
55,B001RVFDOO,5,O. M. G. These ROCK!,"I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course. They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",2011-02-21
56,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips,What a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track.  These are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.,2011-02-21

59,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop chips are the best!!!!,"The only complaint I have with pop chips is that I can't get all of the flavors at the stores where I live!!!

We cannot say enough good things about them!",2011-01-31
60,B001RVFDOO,5,Great and unique chips!,"I LOVE PopChips.  They have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste.  They are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy.  If you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving, these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories.",2011-01-30
61,B001RVFDOO,4,"Some are REALLY tasty, others a little ""chemical"" tasting",The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own<br />The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories<br />The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent.<br />The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.<br /><br />Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.<br /><br />If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.<br /><br />So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.,2011-01-30

Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt.""",2011-01-30

64,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummy!,I received my box of assorted Popchips a few days ago to support my Weight Watcher meal plan.  I absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan.  Without hesitation I recommend all varieties of these chips.  What a great idea!!!,2011-01-26

Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack.<br />Unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than I had anticipated.  Time to order some more!  All the different flavors are seasoned just right--not too salty or spicy.  I love Popchips!",2011-01-15

I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!!",2011-01-13

I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through.",2011-01-07
69,B001RVFDOO,5,Loved the chips,We absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from Amazon we were able to find them in Target.  They have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren't trying to loose weight.  Recommended by weight watchers.,2010-12-28

71,B001RVFDOO,4,Popchips,I really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat.  I especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar.  I don't care for the salt and pepper.  I wish I could get a multipack and choose the flavors I want.,2010-12-16

77,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips - Love !,"I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family.",2010-11-14

In fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited!  Amazing how it is made.  Calorie count is great too! I went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them.  My third order I placed for a gathering of 12 friends.  They too, could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made. I feel the product itself won over more prospective customers. Try it yourself, I know you will be very pleased.<br /><br />Trish Kowalski",2010-10-15

85,B001RVFDOO,5,Delicious!,"I hate healthy anything!<br /><br />But I am overweight, so I need an alternative to my normal routine of Doritos potato chips. The only reason I tried these chips is because of the other reviews, so I am contributing my 5 stars toward the product.<br /><br />From just looking at it, I was expecting it to taste more like rice cake... but I was pleasantly surprise. The chips tastes great, very crisp... I don't really know how to explain it.<br /><br />All the flavors are great. My favorite is the BBQ. The Original is a bit too salty, but still very tasty.<br /><br />Highly recommended! At least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack.",2010-10-11
86,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips Satisfy my Salt and Crunch Craving,"I'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things I really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds!

87,B001RVFDOO,4,YUM!,I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!,2010-10-09
88,B001RVFDOO,5,Very happy!,"These taste great and are a healthier alternative. My favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. I probably won't order the other flavors again since I have a favorite, and don't eat potato chips all that often. But the variety pack was great to get to try them all.",2010-10-02
89,B001RVFDOO,5,Awesome Product,"These are great - my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch - and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal ""chip"" out on the market.  Great flavor - BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags - wish you could buy them at the store - but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!",2010-09-29

95,B001RVFDOO,5,Delish,"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!",2010-09-18
96,B001RVFDOO,5,Different and yummy!,"I agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options.  The texture of the chips is great and they're very flavorful!  I can certainly taste the sodium but if this isn't a problem for you, I would recommend trying them.  It's a snack I look forward to having a chance to enjoy.  Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.<br /><br />My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  These Popchips are exactly right.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty, flavorful snack!",2010-09-17
97,B001RVFDOO,5,Loved these chips!,"I loved these chips. They were exactly what I had been looking for. They are not fried/greasy or baked/dry they were great-tasting, satisfying, and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. You can feel good about eating these chips. Can't say enough, you'll have to try them for yourself! I am ordering more now!",2010-09-17
98,B001RVFDOO,4,Great alternative to regular potato chips,"Although I can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips, they are a good alternative and very tasty. The flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store; it is the texture that is different. They are less oil (a good thing) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper. All of the flavors are good except for the cheese one. I didn't care for it although my two-year-old likes it.<br /><br />All-in-all, for the calories, you can't beat it, and for long term weight maintenance and health, these are great and delicious as well. Amazon.com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store.",2010-09-03
99,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop Chips,The chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and Weight Watcher point value.,2010-09-01
100,B001RVFDOO,5,Yum!,"I was on the fence about buying these for months. I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again.",2009-10-16
101,B001RVFDOO,5,Awesome Chips!!!!!!!!!!!,"I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it.",2009-05-28
102,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips RULE!,"Popchips are really, really good! Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other ""diet"" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories - only 100 cal. per single-serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors - some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non-dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo-cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS!",2009-10-06
103,B001RVFDOO,5,Definite POP - Not Baked or Fried,"Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie:<br />-Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.<br />-Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.<br />-Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.<br />-Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type.<br />-Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the ""potato"" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste.<br />I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity.",2010-05-14

So I'd buy a single, small package at your grocers and try them out.  Not for everyone, and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys.  Even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate.  Crispness is OK.  Even mouth feel is good, but there is a lingering (not good) taste - again, kind of like Pringles.

First time time tasting it was during the Natural Product Expo West 2009 in Anaheim, fell in love with it almost right away.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about this product was probably the price, which is higher compared to chips of other brands.  In addition, the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack.<br /><br />Amazon's pricce on this item, along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously.  if you have a costco nearby, you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price, slightly higher than what Amazon offers though.",2010-08-16

135,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummy!!!!!,Great product! All the flavors were delicious. Loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.,2010-07-19

137,B001RVFDOO,5,excellent!,I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!,2010-07-18
138,B001RVFDOO,5,Delicious,PopChips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips. I love all the flavors !! It's also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags.,2010-07-14
139,B001RVFDOO,5,Eat without feeling guilty!,Fabulous - tasty but not awful for you!  I've already recommended to folks I work with.  Will continue to purchase!,2010-07-04
140,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop chips variety,It is simple. These chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. Way better than anything baked! I highly recommend them!,2010-07-02
141,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips,The Popchips were excellent - had excellent flavor and low in calories.  When you eat these - don't need another potato chip!,2010-07-01
142,B001RVFDOO,5,These definately are 5 stars.  Deeelicious,"These chips are delicious and low in calories.  I love the salt and vinegar, and the barbeque.  We buy them by the case.  They are great.  Thanks for offering them.",2010-06-29
143,B001RVFDOO,5,Love pop chips!,"I love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic.  Delivered quickly - these chips are filling, full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips.",2010-06-27
144,B001RVFDOO,5,pop chip goodness,"I first tried them after a product get together at Jelly Belly in Fairfield, Ca. I was so pleased, that I wanted more!  Well my Husband said he saw some at Costco so he got a few flavors and boy was I hooked. I sent my Grandsons in Idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in Ohio the same thing.  I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree",2010-06-11
145,B001RVFDOO,4,Delicious and The Right Amount,"Pop-Chips are VERY GOOD!  I'm on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  I think I even like these better than regular chips!  The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.<br /><br />Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.",2010-06-11
146,B001RVFDOO,5,BEST chips!!,"My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the ""BEST"" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip. I highly recommend these to anyone that can't do without eating chips either with a sandwich, hamburger, or just to munch on midday.<br />You won't be dissapointed.",2010-06-07
147,B001RVFDOO,5,Love those chips,The pop-chips are great. I had heard they were really good and I totally agree. I love being able to have all the flavors. I like the variety.<br />The chips were delivered quickly and safely.,2010-05-23

149,B001RVFDOO,5,Everyone Should To Try These At Least Once,"If I had to describe a Popchip, I would say that it's a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake.  I was a little skeptical, at first, since I was trying to figure out how they were made if they weren't baked or fried, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them.  This variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite(s).  If you're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a must-try.",2010-05-13
150,B001RVFDOO,5,Fully enjoyed,"I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.<br /><br />The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.<br /><br />I recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack.",2010-05-04
151,B001RVFDOO,5,Great low-cal snack!,"For 100 calories a bag, these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips, they have great crunch and flavor.",2010-04-06
152,B001RVFDOO,5,So good!,"These are crunchy and very tasty!  These don't taste like the 'usual' chips from the store.  When I first tried them, I could tell right away they were different from the greasy, salty, fatty chips I was used to eating.  These have their own flavor and crunch and I started to appreciate them right away.  I noticed I didn't feel so sluggish and icky after eating these.  Which was wonderful.  The combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty.  And I love the smaller packages.  They really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging.",2010-04-05
153,B001RVFDOO,5,these are awesome,"the pop chips are really incredible. They are very flavorful and crispy. My Favorite is the BBQ, but that is just me, they are all good. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health.",2010-03-30

156,B001RVFDOO,5,Loved it!,"Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.",2010-03-03
157,B001RVFDOO,5,Worth The Money!,"These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.",2010-03-01
158,B001RVFDOO,5,I love Pop Chips!,"The reason why I ordered this on-line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones - actually I love ALL of them, but it's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they weren't I wouldn't be able to stop eating them.",2010-03-01
159,B001RVFDOO,5,Great chip substitute!,I love these chips...and my husband does too. He wipes them out before I can get to them. The variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. They are packaged well and always fresh. The bag contains a generous portion. I've purchased many times and am never dissapointed.,2010-02-22
160,B001RVFDOO,5,Great low-fat no cholestrol snack,"This is a great chip replacement! Wow all the flavors are terrific,good with a sandwich, soup, or just a late night snack!",2010-02-02
161,B001RVFDOO,5,Great Chips,Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.,2010-01-30
162,B001RVFDOO,5,Entire family loves them,"loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them.  low fat, lower calorie and all natural, simple snack for kid's lunch bags. It is peanut and tree nut free (safe for allergy kids) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat, I bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet.",2010-01-23
163,B001RVFDOO,5,YUM!!!,"I am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest, non-homemade chips I've ever had. Plus they're healthy! Only problem is I can't decide which flavor is my favorite.",2010-01-20
164,B001RVFDOO,5,CHIP LOVER,"I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips.

165,B001RVFDOO,5,BBQ is terrific!,"I love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day.  The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips, but there is no savings buying the from Amazon.",2010-01-17

172,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips,These are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips.  Not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the WHOLE bag it's ok!!!  Great product and I would highly recommend it anyone.,2009-12-25
173,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummy!,I originally found these at a Target out of my home town. I fell in love with them as part of my Weight Watcher's plan. They are a good snack alternative when I crave something salty. I could not find them where I live so I purchased them from the Pop Chips web site which took me through Amazon. Yummy!,2009-12-20
174,B001RVFDOO,5,Great Natural Potatoe Chips With Low Calories!,"This is one of the best new products I have ever tried in a long time.....These are delicious chips, they taste like chips, ( not styrofoam) and are all natural !<br />The Barbeque are outstanding, as are the plain, sour creme and onion, salt and pepper. I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co-workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!<br /><br />Overall an excellent product !",2009-12-17
175,B001RVFDOO,5,Taste great,These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!,2009-12-17
176,B001RVFDOO,5,Love at first bite,"Love, love, love these crunchy little treats.  They remind me of ""Munchos"" but without the greasy tounge afterwards.  I don't usually like flavored snacks, but these are all great, not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste.  I subscribe to them so I will never run out:)",2009-12-08
177,B001RVFDOO,5,Fantastic Product !!!!!,What's to say - Pop Chips are great!!!  Kudos to the PoP Chip makers.,2009-11-21
178,B001RVFDOO,5,Sooo tasty,"I really liked these chips.<br /><br />They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.<br /><br />The cheddar, bbq, and salt/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.<br /><br />The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.<br /><br />Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos.",2009-11-03
179,B001RVFDOO,5,absolutely delicious,I love these chips so much... and I can't get over how delicious each variety is!! The price here is AWESOME too!,2009-10-30
180,B001RVFDOO,5,"Healthier, better tasting option","I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)",2009-09-23
181,B001RVFDOO,5,Deliciousness for little calories!,These chips are incredible! Enough can't be said about them. They are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories!,2009-09-19
182,B001RVFDOO,5,Healthy yum.,I love these chips! They always make a great healthy snack when I'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.,2009-09-18
183,B001RVFDOO,5,Excellent!!,"Love these pop-chips! The variety bag was a great deal, especially with the $5 off.  Tasty, low fat- just what I needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. I highly recommend these!",2009-09-17
184,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips - The perfect snack to pop in your mouth,"I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative.",2009-07-09
185,B001RVFDOO,5,LOVE THEM,Love All THE FLAVORS!!!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE PACKAGE AND TASTE GREAT!!!!! GIVE THEM A TRY YOU WILL LOVE THEM ALSO!!!!!,2009-06-27
186,B001RVFDOO,5,crunch without guilt,"I discovered Pop Chips a year or so ago, and my whole family LOVES them!  We are partial to crunchy, salty snacks (like potato chips) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload.  These are a perfect substitute!  Great to tide you over between meals, or with a sandwich, or a movie-watching snack.  The small size bags are perfect for NOT getting too carried away, too!",2009-06-21
187,B001RVFDOO,4,great taste now in a 100 calorie bag,"I love popchips, The bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but If you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. These are for you. A bit pricey but worth it.",2009-06-15
188,B001RVFDOO,5,Love this product!!,"I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured ""what the heck!"". WOW -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is AWESOME! I particularly liked the salt & pepper. If you want crunch and flavor - these are for you!!",2009-06-10
189,B001RVFDOO,1,Weird flavors....,"I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting. Only the original flavor tasted good, so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. I would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. Pirate's Booty makes popped chips that are way better.",2011-05-26
190,B001RVFDOO,3,Can someone post some of the nutrition facts?,"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!",2011-06-05
191,B001RVFDOO,5,These are a great snack,"I shared these with my two older sons, then ordered more. These are great to put in the glove compartment for after work.",2010-09-11
192,B001RVFDOO,3,pretty good  - but won't buy again,"I decided to try these based on the reviews - they are pretty good - especially for a more healthy option, but not sure I'll get them again.",2012-06-30
193,B001RVFDOO,2,Not impressed,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",2012-05-27
194,B001RVFDOO,1,disgusting,Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.,2012-03-08
195,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop Chips Are Tops,in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.,2011-11-27
196,B001RVFDOO,2,I did not like the taste!,OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...<br /><br /> I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!<br /><br /> Just not for me!,2011-07-03
197,B001RVFDOO,2,Didn't like the taste,"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her.",2011-07-02

199,B001RVFDOO,5,popchips,"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips.",2011-06-28
200,B001RVFDOO,5,fantastic mix of Popchip goodness,"We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!",2011-06-23

208,B001RVFDOO,2,We really didn't like these!,"I decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were...Bad idea!  I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!",2011-02-07
209,B001RVFDOO,3,They're Okay.......,"Not anything to rave about. They were okay. I think if I truly had a craving for chips I would just buy and eat ""regular"" ones. Won't buy again.",2010-11-18

211,B001RVFDOO,3,Nothing special - Baked Lays taste better,"Although they are mildly healthier, they don't taste as good as Baked Lays.<br /><br />Also, having a huge box of chips around isn't necessarily healthy because I ended up eating them more often.<br /><br />They are worth a try, but they just seem a bit overpriced (even with subscription savings) and over-hyped.",2011-04-12
212,B001RVFDOO,3,Cross between Pringles and a rice cake. The bonus is they're all natural,"They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.<br /><br />~ The Good ~<br />Good flavor, no too strong or weak.<br />Crunchy, but not too dry.<br />Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.",2012-06-20
213,B001RVFDOO,2,Too strong of flavors,"I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.",2012-05-09
214,B001RVFDOO,3,If you're expecting full chip flavor reconsider getting another brand of chips.,I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.,2012-02-24
215,B001RVFDOO,5,Great for losing weight!,"I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did.<br />All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag, they are a great snack. They quell that hunger for crunchy, salty, goodness without killing my diet. Yes, they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips, but it stops me from eating just a couple more and 1 bag is really enough to keep me happy. I've got a new favorite chip.",2011-09-21
216,B001RVFDOO,5,Good chips and not bad for you,"If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more.",2011-09-20

218,B001RVFDOO,3,Tasty but Salty,"So for a ""healthier"" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt.",2010-10-11
219,B001RVFDOO,3,Not as good as I was lead to believe,"I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being ""healthy"" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well.",2010-09-04
220,B001RVFDOO,5,GREAT CRUNCH SOLUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I HAPPENED UPON THIS ITEM IN MY LOCAL DELI AND BEING CURIOS I DECIDED TO TRY.  THEY WERE FABULOUS BETTER THAN THE REGULAR CHIPS BY FAR.  I GIVES YOU SATISFACTION OF CRUNCH AND FLAVOR IN A POTATOE CHIP.  GREAT GREAT FIND.,2010-04-23
221,B001RVFDOO,4,"Pop Chips, yum!","I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!",2010-03-02

223,B001RVFDOO,2,Popchips vs Baked Lays? Baked Lays taste MUCH better.,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )",2011-04-16

244,B001RVFDOO,4,"Tasty, Crunchy, and Filling","I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.",2011-06-22

248,B001RVFDOO,5,Buy them less from here!!! (While you can),"I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases, shipping is free! Get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through!<br /><br />All of the flavors are really good.  I even liked the BBQ which I normally do not like in a chip. The cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick.

250,B001RVFDOO,5,My new favorite chips!,"I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!",2011-03-13
251,B001RVFDOO,5,This picky eater loves them (most flavors),"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.",2011-02-05

Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things ""healthy"" and ""low fat"" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people.",2010-07-02
254,B001RVFDOO,5,"Tasty potato chips, low in calories, great flavor","I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat.

255,B001RVFDOO,5,"Love, love, love these chips!!","Wow, these chips are delicious!<br /><br />They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil-smothered grocery store chips.<br /><br />The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!<br /><br />If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!",2009-10-07
256,B001RVFDOO,5,"All the taste, but where's the fat?","This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!",2009-10-07
257,B001RVFDOO,3,"Not bad, but not impressive! .8 oz equals about 15 chips.","Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.",2010-05-03

259,B001RVFDOO,3,Not bad But not great,I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not. BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-,2010-05-29

Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.<br /><br />This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.<br /><br />I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others.",2012-09-30

283,B001RVFDOO,1,"poor,poor packaging","These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??",2012-05-31

This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.",2012-05-15
286,B001RVFDOO,5,Popchips Does It for Me,"I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along.",2012-04-30

290,B001RVFDOO,3,"Taste alright, but normal chips are better","These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.",2012-04-15
291,B001RVFDOO,5,Love it! so tasty!,I have subscribed these chips. They are so tasty. Not dry or oily. Cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.,2012-04-15
292,B001RVFDOO,5,Pop Delicious,"I love these chips. They are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. All the flavors allow you to taste them all.  My favorite flavor is the cheese ones. Go ahead and try them.  They are so delicious.",2012-04-09
293,B001RVFDOO,3,Like slightly charred popcorn,"I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of ""burnt"" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.",2012-04-07
294,B001RVFDOO,5,Yummie!,"I found these chips originally at a local market.  However, I have been unable to find them since.  WHEW!  what a relief when I was able to locate them.

295,B001RVFDOO,5,Delicious!,"These chips are great. Delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips. I have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious. I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon.",2012-04-01

297,B001RVFDOO,2,overrated,"These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.",2012-03-23
298,B001RVFDOO,5,Not for everyone.. but I love it!,"I'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly-palatable junk food. Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.",2012-03-18
299,B001RVFDOO,4,Most flavors are very good,"I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.<br />I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.",2012-03-18
300,B001RVFDOO,4,Great idea,"This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order.",2012-03-10
301,B001RVFDOO,5,"Healthy and Good, What?!?!","Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed.
