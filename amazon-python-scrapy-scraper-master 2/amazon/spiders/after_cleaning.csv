1,B000G6RYNE,5,04/16/2012,"Kettle potato chips: Fully loaded baked potato I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!"
2,B000G6RYNE,5,04/12/2012,"Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product. After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out."
3,B000G6RYNE,4,04/09/2012,"glad to find them in 1 oz size I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10."
4,B000G6RYNE,4,04/09/2012,"pretty good, could be better Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10."
5,B000G6RYNE,5,04/05/2012,"a slight taste of jalapeno one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others. There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous..."
6,B000G6RYNE,5,03/15/2012,"Best chips ever The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!"
7,B000G6RYNE,5,03/06/2012,"Kettle potato chips: Sweet onion WOW! I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT."
8,B000G6RYNE,5,03/04/2012,"Ridiculously Good I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24) and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control."
9,B000G6RYNE,5,01/29/2012,"Delicious! Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please! With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store."
10,B000G6RYNE,4,01/23/2012,"PUCKER UP I love Kettle Brand Chips!I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time. I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips."
11,B000G6RYNE,5,01/15/2012,I love these chips. They are thick and crunchy! These chips are thick and crunchy. I absolutely love them. The taste is perfect. I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
12,B000G6RYNE,4,01/08/2012,"Quite good I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag."
13,B000G6RYNE,5,01/08/2012,"Delicious I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
14,B000G6RYNE,5,01/04/2012,"Salty and vinegary!!! These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had. I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful. Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving)."
15,B000G6RYNE,5,12/01/2011,"WOW!!!! I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them."
16,B000G6RYNE,5,11/19/2011,Best gluten-free dairy-free chips These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips. Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat. The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.
17,B000G6RYNE,4,09/10/2011,"A unique flavor for fans of Thai food These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions ""tear here."" So easy. Why didn't I think of that."
18,B000G6RYNE,3,05/06/2011,"Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips."
19,B000G6RYNE,5,05/05/2011,"Yowzah!! For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors."
20,B000G6RYNE,4,03/23/2011,Very good. Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
21,B000G6RYNE,5,03/19/2011,"Excellent! What I like about them:1) Very thick chips.2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.Cons:As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."
22,B000G6RYNE,5,02/16/2011,"Tangy goodness. These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory."
23,B000G6RYNE,3,02/12/2011,"Heavy on the Vinegar I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste."
24,B000G6RYNE,4,01/24/2011,"A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor I have always been a fan of Kettle chips. When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality. These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them. You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might. The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth. On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase. The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven. Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain. This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic. The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!"
25,B000G6RYNE,5,12/17/2010,BEST BUY in BBQ Chips Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!
26,B000G6RYNE,5,11/23/2010,"Love Them! Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.Crunchy, real potato chips!"
27,B000G6RYNE,5,11/20/2010,"Crunchy and Tasty These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips."
28,B000G6RYNE,5,11/07/2010,"Convenience at low cost I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!"
29,B000G6RYNE,3,11/04/2010,"An Acquired Taste OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)"
30,B000G6RYNE,5,10/17/2010,"Best deal ever! This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh. Love it:)"
31,B000G6RYNE,5,08/11/2010,Yum! My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
32,B000G6RYNE,5,02/20/2010,"Barbeque perfection The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
33,B000G6RYNE,5,01/19/2010,"Excellent Thai-flavored chip I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag. I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment. Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful. These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon. The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate. The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy. Was sour in there too? I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting."
34,B000G6RYNE,5,11/15/2009,"Best Kettle Chips! As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!"
35,B000G6RYNE,5,11/12/2009,"The Supreme Salt & Vinegar These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy. They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted. These are certainly my favorite chips. I highly recommend trying them!"
36,B000G6RYNE,5,10/20/2009,"Delicious as always! Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon."
37,B000G6RYNE,5,08/18/2009,"OooH Yummy! I LOVE these chips! It is a little weird to review potato chips. But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all. This 2 oz package allows for a little ""portion control"". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!"
38,B000G6RYNE,4,08/04/2009,"Not quite the best... In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips, from the best I've ever had to big disappointments. If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products. Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors. All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice."
39,B000G6RYNE,4,06/15/2009,"want to gaain twenty pounds with no control whatsoever? Buy this! these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE"
40,B000G6RYNE,5,06/14/2009,"One of Their Best Flavors Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss. Some of their flavors are terrible. But this is very simple and delicious. Probably one of their best flavors.Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip serviceCons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open. They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag. Use scissors instead."
41,B000G6RYNE,5,06/10/2009,"Love these chips! We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live."
42,B000G6RYNE,5,03/17/2009,"Highly addicitive chips I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!"
43,B000G6RYNE,5,01/14/2009,These are AWESOME! These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!
44,B000G6RYNE,5,01/11/2009,"One bite and you'll become a ""chippoisseur"" I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.I also recommend Kettle Chips Honey Dijon and Kettle Chips Spicy Thai.Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""
45,B000G6RYNE,5,01/11/2009,"Crunchy, salty, sweet...finally, a Superbowl snack that scooores! These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat.

46,B000G6RYNE,5,01/09/2009,These chips make me weak at the knees These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!
47,B000G6RYNE,5,09/14/2008,"By far my favorite chips These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks. I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
48,B000G6RYNE,4,09/10/2008,"Good chips, more cheese They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."
49,B000G6RYNE,4,08/26/2008,Pretty good tasting chip It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
50,B000G6RYNE,4,07/29/2008,"Yummy chips These are delicious. The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
51,B000G6RYNE,4,07/29/2008,"Best sour cream & onion chip I've had I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are. The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends. I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good. I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better. If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk. They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag."
52,B000G6RYNE,5,07/27/2008,"Great chips We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
53,B000G6RYNE,5,07/25/2008,"Fabulous! These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!"
54,B000G6RYNE,5,07/13/2008,"Box-o-Chips These chips were a great deal. Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips. They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected."
55,B000G6RYNE,5,07/07/2008,fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
56,B000G6RYNE,4,07/05/2008,An addictive potato chip Eat at your own risk. Once I would open a bag I could not stop. Good and salty.
57,B000G6RYNE,5,07/05/2008,"Great Chip! I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
58,B000G6RYNE,5,07/04/2008,"Excellent balance of taste, crunchiness, and moisture I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends. :)) My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side. But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind. Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore."
59,B000G6RYNE,5,07/04/2008,Yum Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them. They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
60,B000G6RYNE,5,07/03/2008,"Very good chips at a great price. These chips are quite tasty and the price is right. Packaged very well, would buy again."
61,B000G6RYNE,2,06/29/2008,70% of the chips in the bag are over cooked I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked. I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.Will never buy these chips from here again.
62,B000G6RYNE,5,06/28/2008,Great chips! For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them. They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing. I would order groceries online.
63,B000G6RYNE,4,06/20/2008,"Not bad but a little hard to get used to My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."
64,B000G6RYNE,4,06/20/2008,"Firm quality chip Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there."
65,B000G6RYNE,2,06/19/2008,"Not Very Creamy or Chivey... I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
66,B000G6RYNE,3,06/10/2008,"Prefer other flavors I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24). Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."
67,B000G6RYNE,5,06/02/2008,"These will be habit forming! I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get. These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat."
68,B000G6RYNE,2,05/14/2008,"Good and tangy I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
69,B000G6RYNE,5,03/27/2008,the best chips ever We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them! We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money. We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
70,B000G6RYNE,5,02/21/2008,"I do not even like kettle chips and I love these A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , ""these will change your life!"" While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips. For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing! The are the type of hot that is refreshing. If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you."
71,B000G6RYNE,5,02/21/2008,"You have to love sea salt and vinegar already But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country."
72,B000G6RYNE,5,02/19/2008,"Addictive These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted. It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping. The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination. I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do. And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too. They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."
73,B000G6RYNE,5,01/26/2008,"amazing chips i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them."
74,B000G6RYNE,5,12/03/2007,"Best Chip Ever This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had. Look at the ingredients: Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper. How can you go wrong?Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these. They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food."
75,B000G6RYNE,4,08/08/2007,"Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my! Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip. Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned. They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off. The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai. It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger. If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them. The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."
76,B000G6RYNE,4,07/11/2007,"An indulgence with a bite Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eatvery many. That makes them an indulgence thatrescues some people from overindulgence."
77,B000G6RYNE,5,07/02/2007,"The best I've had I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted. Every flavor is dynamite. If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing. And they're healthy! (besides a lil fat) I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake. Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast."
78,B000G6RYNE,5,03/07/2007,"Excellent chip! I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!"
79,B000G6RYNE,2,06/20/2008,salt and vinegar chips It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
80,B000G6RYNE,5,10/01/2012,Delicious!! Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
81,B000G6RYNE,4,01/30/2012,"I like them. Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it."" That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips. These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor. The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag. Really? Who can eat half and save the rest for later??? Not me..."
82,B000G6RYNE,5,09/21/2011,"Love Kettle Chips These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.Enjoy."
83,B000G6RYNE,5,12/16/2010,Best unsalted chips These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many. They have the best potato flavor. They came when you said they would.
84,B000G6RYNE,5,10/22/2010,"So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them. Great chips, great price. Odds are that you will have them to yourself. If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these. The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you). They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own. Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind. -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels. It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again. Mmmmm... vinegar..."
85,B000G6RYNE,2,07/16/2009,"Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor! I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite."
86,B000G6RYNE,1,01/30/2009,"Maybe the worst chips ever. These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
87,B000G6RYNE,1,09/11/2009,"Surprise 1 It's different... Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays. These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty. Now, no longer my favorite."
88,B000G6RYNE,5,01/18/2008,Tasty Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
89,B000G6RYNE,4,08/26/2011,"Crisp I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished... I don't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage, but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart. Luckily, there were no victims within. All the chips are as they should be."
90,B000G6RYNE,3,02/06/2011,Vinegar... Not my taste! This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste. Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before. I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
91,B000G6RYNE,5,12/15/2010,"spicy thai chips TOTALLY ORGASMIC. these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted. signed up for the subscribe and save option. the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS. the price per unit equals $1.73 per package. that is not even the cost of plain chips. if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal. so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS. p.s. even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve. ENJOY"
92,B000G6RYNE,5,12/01/2010,"Delicious, what else did you expect? Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.Bottom-line: Delicious!"
93,B000G6RYNE,5,11/29/2010,"Great Value Despite coming in an extremely large box, I found this to be great value. All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. I'd definitely recommend."
94,B000G6RYNE,1,07/13/2010,"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips"" These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all. I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck. Give me pain chips any day. Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
95,B000G6RYNE,4,01/31/2010,"Spicy but good If you like spicy, then these are for you. I like spicy, so I enjoyed these. They're also crunchy, as kettle-cooked chips should be."
96,B000G6RYNE,3,12/24/2009,"boulder salt and malt vinegar chips are way better These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips. THOSE are awesome."
97,B000G6RYNE,2,11/18/2009,"POTATO CHIPS Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
98,B000G6RYNE,5,10/10/2009,"Lightly Salted, Heavily Delicious! These are the best potato chips that money can buy. There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you've wolfed down a bag of these beauties. Each chip has the perfect thickness - my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth! Everything about these chips is so perfect, it's like they were made by God and delivered by Gabriel himself. Now that I know Amazon carries these, I don't even have to leave my house to buy them! I may never eat anything else again!"
99,B000G6RYNE,3,08/25/2009,"Too Much Flavor These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness."
100,B000G6RYNE,5,04/01/2008,"Love at first bite! Tongue-puckering tang and crunch! I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy. I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten. It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly. I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch. Isn't that poetic?As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C. My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch. Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them. That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids! For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far. It isn't easy, but ...Have I told you how much I love them?Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"
101,B000G6RYNE,5,07/27/2007,"The Best Chips...PERIOD! You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."
102,B000G6RYNE,5,01/17/2008,"Delicious Extra Crunchy These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!Enjoy!"
103,B000G6RYNE,5,01/10/2009,"Chip snob alert! It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best."
104,B000G6RYNE,5,02/10/2008,Best Salt & Vinegar! I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best! Real sea salt and REAL vinegar! Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness. Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic! :)
105,B000G6RYNE,5,03/23/2007,"Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips! Kettle brand chips are very crunchy. I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum. Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy. If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand. Otherwise, you'll love these chips. The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY. I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time. I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically. Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor. The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"
106,B000G6RYNE,1,09/26/2009,"They changed the Chips now they taste horrible I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy. I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan. About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket. I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it. After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to. They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed. So I e-mailed Kettle with the following: ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering."" I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag. This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks. Please let me know if I can be of any more help."" Well the next bag was good. Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost. I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company. So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle. Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand. increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand. Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."
107,B000G6RYNE,5,01/27/2012,"Do not miss the salt! Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips. Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out. OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD! I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting. I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips. Truly delicious!"
108,B000G6RYNE,5,02/17/2009,Great deal These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code. It was nice to have a larger size bag. Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch! They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been. Great flavor and All Natural!
109,B000G6RYNE,5,06/27/2008,"Best Chips out there!!! I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."
110,B000G6RYNE,4,08/30/2008,"Great price, but not as tangy as I expected. Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the ""hard-core"" Salt N Vinegar fans."
111,B000G6RYNE,3,06/21/2008,burnt These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.
112,B000G6RYNE,3,07/11/2007,"Gaaak! An ""extreme"" potato chip...! The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige."
113,B000G6RYNE,2,09/22/2010,"Kettle Chips Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.M. Martin"
114,B000G6RYNE,5,05/18/2012,"Absotively, Posilutely Delicious Chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more; and using them, rather than corn chips, to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like Janet Jackson. (But without any of the associated wardrobe risks. (-:) HIGHLY recommended."
115,B000G6RYNE,1,03/15/2012,"Gone down hill When originally produced in England these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame."
116,B000G6RYNE,1,02/06/2012,completely ripped off after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
117,B000G6RYNE,5,06/25/2011,"C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!! : ) ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E ) I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here. Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.WOW! They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS! Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties. So, comparisons can be made easily. Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips! (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : ) But -- not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious! (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!) These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips. They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:PotatoesVegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),Rice PowderSugarSaltOnion PowderTomato PowderPaprikaTorula YeastGarlic PowderChili PepperCitric AcidCayenne PepperPaprika Oleoresin, (Colour)Natural Smoke FlavourNaturally cooked, natural ingredients. The combination is a true taste treat!Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys. The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes. Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer productionAs far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, thiscan be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes. But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"". I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day. I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour) This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks. It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like. Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,are totally scrumptious. Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat. These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"
118,B000G6RYNE,3,06/14/2009,"Not the Best These chips are okay. Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange. They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty."
119,B000G6RYNE,1,09/27/2010,"STALE. Beware buying these on special! I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning. Keeps you from eating too many! Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one. Unedible. Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
120,B000G6RYNE,4,04/23/2008,"THESE ARE VERY GOOD These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
121,B000G6RYNE,1,02/10/2012,"USED to be my favorite chips Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :("
122,B000G6RYNE,1,02/04/2012,"Stale, Rancid Oil Taste, And if You Like Even the Tiniest Bit of Salt Flavor on Your Chips... ...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!"
123,B000G6RYNE,1,05/31/2011,"Disgusting These chips are nasty. I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease. Nasty!!"
124,B000G6RYNE,2,10/12/2010,"Taste terrible, way too strong Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips. These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food. The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt. Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty. But normal people, please do not try this at home."
125,B000G6RYNE,1,12/28/2009,Over-fried I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
126,B000G6RYNE,4,10/31/2009,No salt Kettle chips. They are good but wish they were also baked. Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. If there are any I wish someone would post.
127,B000G6RYNE,3,01/05/2008,Not as good as the English sell These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.
128,B000G6RYNE,1,04/05/2009,VERY DISAPPOINTED I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSSALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPERTUSCAN 3 CHEESEN.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERSTHEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME. IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
129,B000G6RYNE,1,05/04/2010,"dripping in oil I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
130,B000G6RYNE,2,09/17/2010,"Not so good. If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have ""just a touch."""
131,B000G6RYNE,2,02/18/2009,"Bags O' Salt with chips added. I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
132,B000G6RYNE,1,07/07/2008,"Chips These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy."
133,B000G6RYNE,1,03/02/2012,"Garbage Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips. I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream. Both cases ended up in the garbage can."
134,B000G6RYNE,1,11/16/2008,"They're Not Madhouse Munchies!!! DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
135,B000G6RYNE,1,11/03/2010,"Too SOUR! I love sour food but this one I can't bear. Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong. I don't like it."
136,B000G6RYNE,1,10/04/2010,"AWFUL TASTE Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
137,B000G6RYNE,5,09/02/2007,"delicious I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them. The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful. I would definitely make the purchase again. THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich."
138,B000G6RYNE,1,04/08/2011,"Kettle has sold out, the chips are horrible now Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time. MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free. Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them. Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"". They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.The worst part though is that they taste horrible. Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays. The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.What a shame, no more kettle chips for me. It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method. Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."
139,B000G6RYNE,1,02/26/2011,"The bags were damaged with holes and stains. The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."
140,B000G6RYNE,1,01/05/2011,"Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse. Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch. When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon. The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which. I will never buy these again from Amazon. I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase. It makes me sick to think about it!I included pictures at the top of the page. Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.Update: I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them."
141,B000G6RYNE,5,02/25/2008,"orgasmic Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented. I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor. I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips."
142,B000G6RYNE,5,10/14/2007,"A tang that packs a punch! My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods. These are her absolute favorite chips! She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time. I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
143,B000G6RYNE,5,03/27/2007,"great (hot) new flavor.... I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food. I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....) These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue. Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!). Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."
144,B000G6RYNE,1,04/05/2012,"HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS! Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
145,B000G6RYNE,5,02/12/2012,"Favorite Kettle flavor and a great value! After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"
146,B000G6RYNE,1,01/06/2012,"Kettle Brand Potato Chips - New York Cheddar Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar: These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old. I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then. But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me."
147,B000G6RYNE,5,12/08/2011,My favorite flavor I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
148,B000G6RYNE,5,10/04/2011,"So much flavor your farts will smell like sweet onions These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. Just don't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. They'll totally know it was you."
149,B000G6RYNE,5,09/04/2009,"Great Chip! With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful. Some of their flavors are nauseating. With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips. Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown. They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt. I can't recommend these chips enough. You won't regret it.Some people say they are burnt but they aren't. From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber. The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true. But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging."" That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor. I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips. For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get. Period."
150,B000G6RYNE,5,04/20/2009,"Awesome and delicious! These are among the best chips I have ever eaten! I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007. I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try. I was hooked. I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time. I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them. I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor. However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read ""Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!""You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels. They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon! I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed! They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods! Buy some today, and fall in love like me!"
151,B000G6RYNE,5,03/28/2009,The only thing I have ever been addicted too...these chips! I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips. I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same. You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!
152,B000G6RYNE,5,01/11/2009,"One bite and you'll become a ""chippoisseur"" I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.I also recommend Kettle Chips Honey Dijon and Kettle Chips Spicy Thai.Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""
153,B000G6RYNE,5,10/02/2008,Good chips I bought these when on sale through Amazon. Nice crispy thick chips. Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
154,B000G6RYNE,1,10/03/2011,"what happened? the recipe has changed For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed. They are just like regular potatoe chips. I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.Yuck!!!"
155,B000G6RYNE,5,08/03/2009,"YUM! If you want a snack, have something REALLY good! I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good. The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!"
156,B000G6RYNE,5,10/08/2012,a good buy This is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best
157,B000G6RYNE,5,10/02/2012,Yoli I love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. These are the only chips I eat
158,B000G6RYNE,4,09/26/2012,Good chips I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
159,B000G6RYNE,5,09/20/2012,Awesome If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
160,B000G6RYNE,1,08/03/2012,"burns the skin off your lips While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
161,B000G6RYNE,5,06/02/2012,"Great chips with very low sodium Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp. I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor."
162,B000G6RYNE,5,04/09/2012,"Kettle Chips I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous. I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores. They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt."
163,B000G6RYNE,4,04/05/2012,"Spicy Thai When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet."
164,B000G6RYNE,5,02/01/2012,"smiles Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you."
165,B000G6RYNE,5,01/30/2012,"My favorite Kettle Chip These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag."
166,B000G6RYNE,5,01/26/2012,Best salt & vinegar chips out there! Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there. These are by far the best. I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy. They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
167,B000G6RYNE,5,01/25/2012,"Amazing Service Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.The Product?These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures."
168,B000G6RYNE,5,06/30/2011,Crunchy and spicy. If you love jalapeno chips then Kettle is a must try.Nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno.Delicious.Addicting.Recommended.
169,B000G6RYNE,4,05/27/2011,"Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . . My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."
170,B000G6RYNE,5,12/26/2010,"Great Tasting Chips After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review. I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly. There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00. The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag. I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all. As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok. Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon. Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping. I'll buy these again...soon."
171,B000G6RYNE,2,11/10/2010,"Kettle Chips, Sea Salt There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
172,B000G6RYNE,3,10/28/2010,"Good deal but close expiration date! I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle. When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt. However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August. I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips. I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable! How convenient! Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date..."
173,B000G6RYNE,5,07/31/2010,"GREAT TASTING CHIPS This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!"

175,B000G6RYNE,5,11/02/2009,"Eating them for years. I found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. After I bought one bag I found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. The New York Cheddar flavor is so good, you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag."
176,B000G6RYNE,5,07/31/2009,These chips will make you fat But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)
177,B000G6RYNE,5,06/30/2009,"Like Spice? Get these These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating. They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up. They are fantastic. If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are. Got my case right here, and loving every bite. On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite. I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle. Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!"
178,B000G6RYNE,5,06/14/2009,"Fantastic I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible. I didn't expect much when I bought these. But after I tasted them I was amazed. I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these. They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips. The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open. Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation."
179,B000G6RYNE,5,05/13/2009,"Sweet, salty, tangy: the way a snack should be Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!)."

I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings.

Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com."

182,B000G6RYNE,5,08/14/2008,"Some of the best chips anywhere Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great. They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack."
183,B000G6RYNE,5,07/28/2008,"the defacto standard for Salt and Vinegar chips I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares."
184,B000G6RYNE,5,07/27/2008,"Yummy! Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy."
185,B000G6RYNE,4,07/20/2008,"Delicious! These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"
186,B000G6RYNE,5,07/07/2008,"Lightly salted, yet tasty This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table."
187,B000G6RYNE,5,07/03/2008,"YUMMY! Kettle Foods, Inc. makes the best tasting potato chips I've ever eaten. With a variety of flavors, from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you'll find the right flavor for your mouth.

188,B000G6RYNE,5,06/02/2008,Caution: Kettle Chips are addictive! These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
189,B000G6RYNE,4,05/29/2008,"The chip with a kiss of salt These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!"
190,B000G6RYNE,5,02/11/2008,"Crunch. Wow! Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.This is an excellent product!"
191,B000G6RYNE,5,08/11/2007,"Great strong flavor I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"". I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent. The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread. Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."
192,B000G6RYNE,5,05/03/2007,"yummy for your tummy The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips."
193,B000G6RYNE,4,05/21/2008,Best Chips Out There! These are my new favorite! I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one! They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here. I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping. I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price. The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.
194,B000G6RYNE,5,12/17/2007,These chips tasted good These chips were good. I ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. I am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.
195,B000G6RYNE,5,11/05/2007,awesome chips these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff
196,B000G6RYNE,3,09/29/2007,I dont know if... I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!
197,B000G6RYNE,5,05/27/2007,"Delicious! At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?"" But I love them. The herbs they used are just delicious. The cheese is not overpowering. They are yummy and crispy!!"
198,B000G6RYNE,2,05/24/2011,"Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market. However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger being the most important that is now missing. Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag. Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me. They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.Here are the original and new ingredient listings:Original IngredientsSelect Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.New IngredientsPotatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extractI'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner, Blue Diamond. They might want to get rid of ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.Great job Kettle! Way to ruin a great thing!"
199,B000G6RYNE,1,02/16/2011,"Expired stock I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.Very bad form amazon."
200,B000G6RYNE,5,03/27/2007,"these potato chips are yummy.... I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store. The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
201,B000G6RYNE,1,05/08/2012,"ONLY awful because SOMETIMES they are awful and THAT is the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
202,B000G6RYNE,4,09/02/2010,"4 Stars for price and taste I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle. I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that. Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price. I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price. You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also. Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are. The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor. These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste. If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first. So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it. They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants. I recommend these, 4 stars."
203,B000G6RYNE,5,06/14/2009,"CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND ROBUST We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these. Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans. I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot. How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."
204,B000G6RYNE,4,06/02/2009,"Tangy and delicious snack For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5."
205,B000G6RYNE,5,08/05/2008,"Best Chip Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the ""fancy"" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!"
206,B000G6RYNE,3,12/20/2007,"Not low salt These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item. They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy. By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
207,B000G6RYNE,5,10/26/2007,"Best Chips I've Ever Tasted Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high."
208,B000G6RYNE,4,10/02/2007,"Tasty! The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.I reccomend them!"
209,B000G6RYNE,5,10/15/2012,Love the smaller bags! My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
210,B000G6RYNE,3,09/11/2012,"Things you need to know Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems."
211,B000G6RYNE,5,09/07/2012,"I made a mistake..... This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips. At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag. But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games. When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips. Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.Sincerely, homiedog"
212,B000G6RYNE,3,08/13/2012,Ok but Miss Vickie's Are Better Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available. I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.
213,B000G6RYNE,3,05/27/2012,"Do they have to ""bite back""? I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though."
214,B000G6RYNE,4,05/10/2012,These chips are awesome if not best but.... I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.
215,B000G6RYNE,4,05/09/2012,"kettle chips This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
216,B000G6RYNE,5,05/05/2012,GREAT DEAL I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips. The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
